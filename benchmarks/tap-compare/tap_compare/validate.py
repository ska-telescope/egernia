"""The agreement gate: the same query must mean the same thing everywhere.

"Identical logical corpus" is a premise the whole comparison rests on, so it
is verified rather than assumed: a fixed set of queries per class runs once
against every target, and row counts plus an order-independent checksum over
``obs_publisher_did`` must agree. A class that disagrees is excluded from
the comparison for that run — recorded, never silently dropped.
