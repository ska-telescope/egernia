"""Closed-loop load generation against any TAP service.

N clients, each issuing the next request when the last returns: this finds a
service's capacity and its latency under a known parallelism, and — unlike an
open loop — cannot overload anything, which is the right property for a
harness pointed at servers we do not own the internals of.

Every request is recorded individually. Aggregates are computed later, from
the samples on disk, so a percentile can be recomputed without re-running
anything and a suspicious summary can always be taken back to the requests it
came from.

``base_url`` is the TAP root (e.g. ``http://localhost:8080/tap``): the sync
endpoint is ``{base_url}/sync`` and the UWS tree ``{base_url}/async``, which
is what TAP 1.1 prescribes and every compared server serves.
