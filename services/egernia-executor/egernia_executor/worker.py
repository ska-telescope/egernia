"""UWS job executor.

Polls uws.jobs for QUEUED jobs (claiming with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED so
multiple executor replicas can run side by side), executes the translated
PostgreSQL query under a read-only role and per-job statement timeout,
writes the serialized result to the shared results volume, and finalizes
the job phase. Also garbage-collects jobs past their destruction time.
