# Performance

Archived benchmark results. They were produced by
`benchmarks/egernia-performance`, a cluster benchmark harness this repository
used to carry, which measured the service, PostgreSQL as the data grows,
replica scaling and autoscaling behaviour separately — because they fail
separately.

That harness has been removed in favour of the timing guards in the
integration suite and the CPU microbenchmarks (see
[Performance testing](../benchmarking.md)). The measurements below stand as
records; the `make benchmark-*` targets and `egernia_bench` commands the pages
reference no longer exist, and the harness itself is in the git history.

Each cluster run below is published in full: the graphs, per-measurement CSV,
and provenance needed to know whether two runs are comparable at all. Focused
capacity checks record smaller local experiments separately.

## Reading these numbers

- A figure without an interval is one measurement. Intervals across
  repetitions are 95% Student-t; percentile intervals within a run are
  percentile bootstrap.
- `LOAD_GENERATOR_BOUND` on any measurement means the client was the
  limit, and nothing else from that measurement describes the service.
- A run marked invalid is published anyway, with the reason. The samples
  are the evidence of what went wrong.
- Two throughputs closer together than the run-to-run variability plot
  shows are the same throughput.
