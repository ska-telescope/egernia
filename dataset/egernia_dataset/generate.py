"""Grow the benchmark database to a series of measured sizes.

Size-driven, not row-driven: generation stops on ``pg_database_size()``, so
"D2 is 10 GiB" is a fact about the database rather than an estimate from a row
count and an assumed row width. One database is grown through every target and
checkpointed at each, so D4 costs 45 GiB of disk instead of D1+D2+D3+D4 = 82,
and each tier is a genuine prefix of the next — the same rows, more of them.

Resumable, because a run that dies at 30 GiB should not start again at zero:
every statement is idempotent on the primary key and the generator continues
from the highest observation index already present.
